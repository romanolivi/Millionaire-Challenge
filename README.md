# Millionare-Challenge

Hello, this is my JavaScript and Ruby on Rails portfolio project called the Millionaire Challenge. This is a very simple app where users take an 10 question quiz consisting of random fill in the blank questions.

for each question you get right you will earn $100,000. If you answer 10 consecutive questions correctly you get the $1,000,000 score, which means you beat the game. However, if you get one question wrong at any point in the game, your score goes to $0 and you have to start all over. You can choose to leave the game and keep your current score if you are satisfied with it.

You can check the leaderboard which will update every time a new score is processed.

I hope you enjoy the project.
